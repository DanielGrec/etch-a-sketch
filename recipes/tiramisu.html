    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tiramisu is a classic no-bake Italian dessert combining espresso-dipped
      ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing triumphant comes for free, so expect a good amount of prep work.
      This recipe requires several bowls and a couple mixing techniques, but
      it’s nothing you can’t handle.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>300 g Savoiardi Ladyfingers.</li>
      <li>500 g of mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>4 medium eggs</li>
      <li>100 g of granulated sugar</li>
      <li>300 ml of coffee</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of Rum</li>
      <li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First of all, make the coffee. For a quick and delicious Italian coffee,
        we used an Espresso Machine. Then add 2 tablespoons of Rum or Marsala
        wine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the yolks and whip the
        egg whites until stiff: you will get at it when the the egg whites will
        not move if you turn the bowl over.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now, in a bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3
        to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with
        a spoon to make it softer. Mascarpone cheese must be of excellent
        quality, creamy and thick. When the yolks are ready add the mascarpone
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the flexible-edge k-beater, slowly whip the mascarpone cream for 2
        to 3 minutes. Now add the stiffly beaten egg whites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix with a wooden spoon, from bottom up. Mix slowly until smooth and
        creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now let’s prepare the layers of ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. You
        can make 2 or more layers, depending on the width and depth of your pan.
        Dip the ladyfingers quickly (1 or 2 seconds) into the coffee. Then
        arrange the ladyfingers in the casserole of your liking.
        <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>. The ladyfingers should not soak too much
        coffee, otherwise the tiramisu will be too rich in coffee and runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange them so that they cover the bottom of the casserole. Then spread
        the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add another layer of ladyfingers and then top with more mascarpone
        cream. If you are making the last layer, spread the mascarpone cream
        generously.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, sprinkle with cocoa powder. You can even add dark chocolate
        chips, if you like.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Allow to rest 3 hours in the refrigerator before serving. Even better if
      you prepare the tiramisu the day before, letting it rest overnight. ENJOY!
